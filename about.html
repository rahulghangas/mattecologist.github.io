## About

I'm a research scientist at Data61, CSIRO. My research is mainly focused on developing analytical solutions for questions relating to biosecurity.

Typically I work on projects involving invertebrates in agricultural systems, and use models to make predictions on how individual species and ecological communities may be affected by global processes such as climate change, biological invasions and application of pesticides. To tackle these large-scale problems I employ multiple analytical techniques, such as community ecology, species distribution modelling, ecophysiological experiments and population genetic studies.

I'm also involved in projects looking to quantify risk posed by non-native species, by understanding population dynamics and spatial processes that define the distribution and abundance of species that might arrive or establish in Australia.

When I'm not at my computer, I'm probably on my mountain bike, reading a Sci-Fi novel or whipping up a mean vegetable curry. All of these activities are of course better with a decent glass of red.
