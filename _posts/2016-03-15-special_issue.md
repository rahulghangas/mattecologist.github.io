title: Special Issue on Insect Invasions
---

Back in 2014 I joined the Centre for Invasion Biology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. My overall project was fairly broad: to investigate insect invasions. While I had some clear research goals in mind, part of this project was to also lead the organisation of a workshop on insect invasions.

This was a pretty big undertaking, and actually ended up consuming a lot of time that year. There were about 40 participants overall, many from Europe, North America and Australia. Organising this was a steep learning curve on grant applications and negotiations with different parties to make all the arrangements. Luckily I wasn't alone and could draw on the experience of my supervisor and a couple of other senior researchers to navigate these tempestuous seas. We were pretty successful overall, and managed to secure funding from both research and industry bodies. This meant we could subsidise the flights for some top speakers and offer an attractive programme.

The workshop was held in November over three days. The first day was daunting, trying to lead discussions and get some coherent goals set out felt like being thrown in the deep end. I was reassured by one of the delegates that this was normal: the first day is chaos and then you bring it back from there. This turned out to be quite true and the discussions became more focussed and productive as the meeting went on. Overall the workshop was a success. It became apparent during the workshop that a special issue was a better goal than a review paper, so we set out to determine a range of potential paper topics that could be addressed with the expertise present. This left us with a good target to meet in the coming year, and spread the workload over a lot of people.

I think there were initially around 18 papers proposed, but that quickly dropped down to around 15 in the planning stages. Being able to act as a guest editor for this issue was a highly rewarding experience. It gave me an opportunity to see the entire publication process, from submission to production, and deal with all the issues that arise along the way. Finding reviewers is a hell of a job. Bringing together completely different reviewer points of view is another tough ask. If nothing else, its given me a newfound respect for the role of the editor and perhaps even a taste of something I'd like to do a bit more of.

In the end there are 13 contributions and an editorial that we wrote to summarise the goals of the workshop and outline the issue. The special issue is structured around four main themes: (1) drivers of insect invasions including introduction pathways, dispersal and propagule pressure; (2) mechanisms of invasion including theories surrounding functional traits and life histories; (3) the impacts of insect invasions for agriculture, human health and ecosystem functioning; (4) and where adaptations facilitating successful invasion and range expansion are likely to occur during the invasion process.
